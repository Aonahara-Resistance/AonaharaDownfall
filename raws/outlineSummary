I don't know how to properly put this into text form but i'll try my best.

Before we get into the actual story here's some things to keep in mind:
1. The player can have a party up to 4 members, but nom himself can't be removed from the party.
There's a special slot reserved for story so technically the player can have up to 5 party member.
2. The player can only equip weapon, accessory and one consumable / character.
3. Enemy only drop life energy upon defeated which is the main currency of the game, however some enemies  
will drop special items.
4. Weapon and accessory is obtained though purchase, boss drop, and from loot chest scattered through the map.
5. "//" is indicating a comment from me and not part of the story itself

Summary

Nom arrive at the train station
he then walk to aonahara
along the way he meet some people and talk for a bit
as he continue his walk he approached by someone
nom coudln't tell who is it because of the clothing the person wear
and before he realize it nom is attacked and fall unconscious

Nom wake up at jason's inn
jason is sitting right next to him
Nom ask where he is and what happened and lastly who is jason
jason is surprised that nom couldn't remember him 
he explained that someone attacked him and he went unconscious
there's a small red mark on nom's forehead but that's about it
Strangely enough altho he can't recall anyone from Aonahara Nom still remember what is Aonahara
Jason tells nom that he spent months in Aonahara
Jason convince Nom to stay and find out why he's here in the first place
Before leaving Jason gives Hom a candy and tells him that it will give Nom a huge boost in his ability 

After leaving Jason's inn nom asks around the area
People are saying that the craftsmen can help
but they're still resting after the festival
However the ex craftsmen Khanh and Emu are still around

> Scenario A: Nom meet Emu
Nom arrive at the miracle shrine and talk with Emu
Nom explains the situation to Emu
and asks emu to help him remember
Emu suggest nom to visit the great archive
but since there's no craftsmen around to ask for entrance emu offers his assistance
after arriving at the main basement entrance 
turns out that emu no longer have access
Emu and nom then go to the emergency exit
after arriving the lid is closed tight
knowing no other way emu decide to blow up the lid himself
then nom and emu descent into the basement
after climbing down the ladder they are now inside
the archieve building is visible from where they are rn due to its towering height
now they're on their way there.

> Scenario B: Nom meet Khanh
Arrived at the cental area of Aonahara nom meet with Khanh
Nom explains the situation to Khanh
Eager to help, Khanh invite nom to find the craftsmen and seek help
Khanh offer nom to help get inside the basement.
after arriving at the main basement entrance 
turns out that Khanh no longer have access
Khanh then decided to enter the basemenet via the water tunnel
after going through the tunnel 
they both lands on a large body of water near the basement garden
from there they can see the great archieve in the distance
and it become their first destination

// Some kind of combat tutorials
Not long after they encounter some wild spirits
Emu/Khanh explains to nom that they are 
the result of high concentration of life energy
which is a fairly commom occurence in the basement
since the area is densely packed with life energy from the deities
but not to this extent

// The weapon on the lore is called "loom"
Emu/Khanh then asks nom to draw out his loom
Nom then realize having a loom despite not remembering where he got it from
Nom think that he must've got it when he was in Aonahara before
furthermore when Emu/Khanh tell him to exterminate the spirit with it
Nom know how to use it despite not remember learning using it
Now Emu/Khanh are now on their way to the great archieve

// If the player decided to explore other area other than to the west
// Emu/Khanh will prompt the player to focus on the great archieve first

Upon arriving at the archieve Nom try to open the door but it is locked
he then try to knock on the door to which rushi responds and let them in
they then talks about the usual reunion stuff
Nom tell rushi that he actually can't remember the time he spent in Aonahara
and he's here to hopefully recover his memorry
after hearing that Rushi become highly alert 
and starting to asks all kind of questions to verify Nom
but since Rushi is asking questions that can only be answered 
by the Nom who didn't lose his memory Nom failed to convince Rushi
even when Emu/Khanh vouch for him Rushi won't budge
Rushi force nom and khanh/emu to leave immediately 
Outside Rushi draws out his loom and challenge Nom to a fight
This is the final verification from Rushi
If this nom is the real deal he will be able to fight rushi quite comfortably
and prove that the loom he brings isn't a stolen item
and if he can't Rushi successfully stop an intruder from wreaking havoc
It's a win win situation for him
Seeing no other choice Nom takes a stance and so is Khanh/Emu

Nom and Khanh/Rushi win
Without a word Rushi opens up the door and let them both in
Rushi then leads Nom to the area that documents history
Rushi finally convinced and he apologizes
Nom forgive Rushi and he understand that rushi is in no wrong
he's just trying to protect the archive
maybe a bit too much but still reasonable

Nom tell Khanh/Emu and Rushi that he's here to accept Food's offer
to become the principal of the school once again
Emu/Khanh encourages Nom to meet Food right away
then Nom asks rushi where's everyone anyway
Rushi answers that after the craftsmen held the festival 
everyone agreed to take a break for a while
at first people stayed inside the basement and lazed around
but soon they found out what they wanted to do while on break
the majority left Aonahara to do the things they want
only a couple of craftsmen remain Rushi is one of them
he always wanted to tidy up the archive and this is the perfect time
then nom asks Rushi is food even here
Rushi said he might be but not quite sure about it
the basement have a communication system built by kitsune
but It has stopped working for quite a while now
maybe Kitsune isn't here to fix it or he might be occupied with something else
without it Rushi can't confirm who's inside the basement and who isn't
he suggests Nom to just wait on the surface
Nom refuses and insists on meeting food as soon as possible
Rushi agrees and tell nom to meet Nitsu to get more information
Rushi can't assist nom since he have stuff to do with the archive first
Nitsu should be up north while nom can go straight there
but Rushi suggests nom to explore for a bit, it's quite a rare opportunity
to attain access (altho forcefully) to the basement for non craftsmen 
Nom keeps rusi's words in mind but he's main objective is till to meet Nitsu


// this is wehere the tutorial part ended
// and the Basement open up fr rn
// the player can go up north and meet Nitsu right away
// the player can go south to the basement garden
// the player can go east to the lakeside area
// the player can go back to the archive to read some stuff
// however the player can't go back to the just surface yet


Scenario A: The player go straight north

when about to enter the boss area
Kahnh/Emu will propmt the player if they want to meet Nitsu right away
if yes then they'll enter the area
there'll be Nitsu already waiting for them
Nitsu then welcome nom back
because of the special occassion Nitsu invite nom to look around
Nitsu shows nom the shrine they built in the QA area
since nom want to know more about the deity this is a perfect opportunity
He of course have seen the shrine on the surface
however the shrine on the surface isn't built for one deity
this shrine is built specifically to respect the Comet deity
with the right mind and hearth nom will be able to connect more with the comet deity
and perhaps borrow some of her energy
Nitsu then shows Nom how he to send an offering to the shrine
Nitsu tells nom that by sending an offering nom can improve
his well being
while this "basement tour" is cool and all nom still have a goal in mind
he then cuts to the chase and asks Nitsu where he can find food
same answer as Rushi's, he might be still in Aonahara but not sure where exactly
he's guessing that food is still in the QA area
Nom jokingly complain that Nitsu's nose isn't good enough
he can smell the arrival Emu/Khanh and nom but not food
nitsu tells nom that it's tricky to smell anything covered by soil
back to it Nitsu asks nom back why does he want to meet food anyway
nom explains his situation
Nitsu understands however he refuses to let nom go further down
Nom and Kahnh/Emu starting to know where this is going
Nom requests for nitsu to at least let him know what are the reasons
he bargained that he came a long way just to get here 
if he have to wait at least he needs some kind of confirmation
Nitsu finally give in and explains to nom
a while ago food noticed something unusual is going on inside the Basement
then he puts all the role leader on high alert
the craftsment weren't told about this issue because food afraid this might be a false alarm
and to not cause panic he only notices the role leaders
Nitsu were stationed to hold this choke point
this is the only way to get deeper into the basement
and until further notice Nitsu shouldn't leave this under any condition
and to make matter worse this is all happened after the communication system broke down
and since kitsune is on break he might not be able to fix it anytime sone
Nitsu can't leave the current position
and he can't can't let nom go down on his own either
so to reiterate Nitsu tells nom that it is best for him to wait and wait until further notice
nom insists and starts to nit pick Nitsu's reasoning and hope he'll change his mind
this however only angers nitsu
Nitsu slowly steps back from Nom
nitsu tries to convice nom for the last time
the reason why Nitsu isn't letting Nom go down is for his own sake
because the basement is densely packed with life energy
someone who have great understanding of it can be a great threat
Nitsu points out how nom's loom can produce a lot more destructive power than on the surface
and if food were right and there's indeed someone who infiltrated the basement
things can get really messy real quick
he then asks for one more time
do nom still insists on going down
Emu/Khanh whispers to Nom that they understand where this is going
and if nom decides to do it they're will do their best
and the chance of getting of getting beaten up is off the chart
they will stay beside nom
nom nods
noms then answers yes
Nitsu draws his loom and points it at nom
"then prove that you're capable"

nom and Emu/Khanh wins
now that Nom have proved himself 
he tells Nitsu to let him through
Nothing but silent comes from Nitsu
after a while Nitsu finally speaks
instead of giving a yes or no to nom's question
Nitsu tells nom to go to the surface with him immediately
nom is furious about the sudden change of mind
they just fought each other like there's no tomorrow
for nitsu just to change his mind
that doesn't make any sense, he says
surprisingly nitsu agrees
no matter how you look at it, this doesn't make any sense
the whole thing is off
There's no reason for Nitsu to guard this place the whole time
while it's true that an order from food should be carried out
There's a lot of other options nitsu could takes
but it didn't even cross his mind
Nitsu afraid that food suspicion is true
Nom is beyond confused by nitsu's word
even khanh/emu doesn't even understand what is Nitsu on about
Nitsu closes his eyes and sniffs around
he then says how many people is still in the QA area
// this is to tell the player how many optional bosses they missed
however Nitsu still suggest for them to go to the surface rn
and they can just inform the rest later

Using nitsu's access they use the main lift to get back to the surface
they arrive at the main entrance 
nitsu tells nom to meet him in Jason's inn
he's going to search for any craftsmen first and invite them too

// this is when the main Aonahara area start to become accessible
// altho there's some special quest places that can't be accessed yet
// the majority of the area will be accessible Now
// even tho Nistu tells the player to go the inn they can roam around first
// interactions other than the main story would not be hosted in this file
// it is instead being hosted in the sidequests section in notion

// the people who'll appear at the inn is rushi nitsu and jason
// but if nom meet more craftsmen before fighting nitsu they'll join
// which are: Nothing and Lightbulbe

Nitsu gathers everyone he can find at the surface
here they are now at the inn
everyone besides nitsu is clueless to what's going on
they just think that Nitsu is helding a gathering to welcome nom
however nitsu is here to discuss an important matter
"Something's off"
everyone goes quite and confused
Nom asks nitsu to elborate
Nitu tells them about food's suspicion
a while ago food felt something unusual was going on inside the basement
and he told the role leaders to be on hight alert
if someone infiltrates the basement 
nitsu will instantly know due to his incredible sense of smell
that's why he is stationed in the very first line of defense
however Nitsu is sure 
that only the craftsmen have entered and leave the basement
with the only exception of nom and emu/khanh
still confused Jason asks nitsu 
so what's this something off Nitsu keep talking about

// If only rushi is the only craftsmen other than nitsu
Nitsu asks rushi did he fight nom back at the basement
Rushi answers with a slow yes
then asks how does Nitsu know

// If the player fight more than just rushi
Nitsu asks how many of the craftsmen fought Nom back at the basement
everyone stare at each other awkwardly
nom yells
"wait a minute, you all did wtf"
confused Rushi asks Nitsu how did he know

// The branch merge here
Nitsu answers because he did too
Jason knows that the craftsmen have their way of doing things
but he didn't know that beating each other up is a reunion ceremony Jason says
Now that everyone is starting to get it nitsu continue explaining
the reason they fight nom might differ but that's not the point
the point is that after fighting nom they have the urge to go to the surface
