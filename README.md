you found the super secret repo of prosperosus

## Set up

We use `git-lfs` to track *ass*ets and chonky files in the repo

1. Install git-lfs if you haven't already `sudo pacman -S git-lfs`
2. Set up the git hooks with `git lfs install` (only needed once per repo per
   machine)

Be sure to install Godot's toolkit with `pip install gdtoolkit` for stuff like
code formatting
